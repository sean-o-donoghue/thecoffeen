## About The Coffeen

Hi there! I’m from Cork, and I’m completely, unapologetically obsessed with coffee.

Not just drinking it (though, trust me, I do a lot of that), but everything about it — the history, the flavours, the weird and wonderful ways it’s made, and the gear that promises the “perfect cup” (spoiler: I’ve probably tried it). I’ll happily chat about beans, brewers, baristas, and why I think pour-over coffee might actually be a form of therapy.

This blog is basically my excuse to ramble about coffee without boring my friends to death. I’ll be sharing my thoughts, reviews, and personal coffee experiments — the good, the bad, and the "why did I think paprika would work in a cold brew?"

Whether you're deep into coffee culture or just wondering what all the fuss is about, you’re welcome here. Grab a mug, pull up a chair, and let’s talk beans.
